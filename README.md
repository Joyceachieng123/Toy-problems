# JavaScript Challenges

Welcome to the JavaScript Challenges repository! This collection of challenges is designed to help you practice your JavaScript programming skills. Each challenge provides a task to solve and a solution to reference.

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find three JavaScript challenges that cover various aspects of programming. These challenges are meant to help you improve your problem-solving skills, as well as gain practical experience in writing JavaScript code.

## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

### Description
Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond to the correct grade, as shown below:

- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 59 to 49
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less than 40

### Usage
- Run the `studentGrade()` function to input student marks and get the corresponding grade.

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector

### Description
Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input (e.g., 80). If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: "License suspended".

### Usage
- Run the `DemeritPoints(speed)` function with the car's speed as an argument to determine if demerit points apply.

## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

### Description
Write a program to calculate an individual's Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e., Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary based on the provided tax rates and deductions.

### Usage
- Use the provided tax rates and deductions from the links below to calculate the net salary:
  - [KRA Tax Rates](https://www.aren.co.ke/payroll/taxrates.htm)
  - [KRA PAYE Calculator](www.kra.go.ke/en/individual/calculate-tax/calculating-tax/paye)

## Conclusion

These JavaScript challenges are a great way to practice your coding skills and enhance your understanding of JavaScript programming. Feel free to explore, modify, and use these challenges to improve your problem-solving abilities. Happy coding!
